# Er komt...

The service, that you can find at [er-komt.herokuapp.com](https://er-komt.herokuapp.com), is
a Dutch *'er'* word trainer.


## Why?

If you're learning Dutch, probably you've heard about the use of this common word. You can
check [this section](http://www.dutchgrammar.com/en/?n=WordOrder.36) on dutchgrammar.com to
get the theory. All you need then is to **practice**, and here is the
[_'er-komt'_](https://er-komt.herokuapp.com) service to help.


## Quiz

It draws a random phrase where _'er'_ (or _'daar'_) is substituted by `__`. You answer and
immediately see the score.
